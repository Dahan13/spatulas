# spatulas

## Requirements :

- A working version of Docker

## How to launch :

Download the release you want. Move the Spatulas.zip archive to where you want it and dezip it. 

Then, in that same folder, type in the terminal :

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

After docker is done, you can open <a href="http://localhost:8080/"> your localhost </a> or the website in any devices if online. Before anything, you should change the master password in '/spadmin' to replace the default 'abcd' password.
